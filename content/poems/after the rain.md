summary: "A portrait of the world renewed after rain, where earth, sky, and mountains come together in perfect composition—a fortunate arrangement of colors, shapes, and life in a single view."

The earth sparkles as new again  
Drying in the cozy warmth of the sun  
Now bathed clean by the tender rain.  
With their job now done,  
Graceful and suave, yet never vain,  
The gallant clouds flaunt their contours  
In a battle of charm  
With the nimble peacocks  
Whose dance beguiles and allures  
So much that the dazed sky now unlocks  
Her long, sumptuous band of colours.

Far off from plain and rocky terrains,  
People take on voyages  
To behold these mighty mountains  
With the skyscrapers and the little cottages  
And the clouds, lakes, and the trees  
And all the other human assemblages,  
Posing together in exquisite harmony.  
They gape at the horizon’s unending expanse,  
This home in its glorious entirety,  
Reveling in this magnanimity of chance  
That brought together in one picture  
Every bright colour,  
Every shape,  
Every grand structure,  
Of this townscape,  
Painted on a canvas handcrafted by nature.

Here is a picture of how the city of Zürich looked from Waid. This scenery, though quite beautiful, was not what stimulated my creativity. I was more affected by the darker, tree-covered trails where I walked within the forest, which didn't seem to make for such a magnificent picture due to the monotony in colour (mostly green and brown) and the lower brightness. Objectively, this scenery of the entire city, with its background of the sky, lake, and mountains, probably does have more to offer to the eye. However, I can assure you that the green-covered shadowy, endless paths of the thick forest were far more appealing to the senses.
