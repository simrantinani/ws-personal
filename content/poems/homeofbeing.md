The being self is a sacred home  
Where feelings come and freely roam  
And thoughts are but the guests of mind  
They arrive uninvited and unrefined.

They sound like echoes in the hall  
Like wavering shadows, my rooms they befall.  
They tell their story, sing their song  
Then they leave, before it is too long.

Joy arrives with laughter and light  
Illuminating my home with all her might  
The horizon is clear, hopeful and bright  
My dreams are set into a soaring flight.

With her, a week passes like a mere day  
And everything impossible turns into a may.  
I am delighted, invite her to forever stay.  
But soon enough, she is on her way.

Empty, bereft, I lament over my plight.  
Then sorrow arrives, in the dark of night.  
Along came helplessness and despair  
Bringing in darkness into my lair.

Another day, fear came by.  
Shook up my frame with many a word.  
Black clouds now fill my whole sky.  
In my home, a storm is stirred.

To fight my angst comes a shower of tears  
The storm subsides, I quell my fears.  
On a short visit then comes tranquility  
I experienced a night of calm stolidity.

One day to my home pride came.  
Inflated my heart and filled up my frame.  
I asked her to stay, always to feel the same  
But soon she was gone, and replaced by shame.

Shame made me shiver and shrink  
Moving my being to a painful brink.  
But my home’s destruction he cannot contrive  
He leaves, as they all do, and I survive.

Emotions and thoughts pass through and slide  
They flow like rivers, they fight like tides.  
They stir the house, make it shake and shiver  
They perturb the host, bring me to a quiver.

They are neither master nor enemy  
Merely passing friends.  
Trying their hand at protecting me.  
They are chosen by my journey’s bends  
To be momentarily my company.  

Violent as they are, when they scream and shout  
I must stay gentle, not try to throw them out.  
For their stay is not for me to resolve  
My task is to ensure my home won’t dissolve.

And when they leave, as all must do,  
I clean up in calm, for the next guests due.  
I let them come, I let them stay,  
I know they will leave one or the other day.
