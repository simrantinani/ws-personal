**Relentless Pursuit**

_Simran Tinani_

There’s a relentless voice in my mind  
That whispers, “no, you must not stop yet!  
It’s not the time to rest, nor to unwind.  
So many worries remain, how can you forget?

It’s not the hour for rest or repose  
The day for respite is not quite near.  
Your duties end not with dusk’s close.  
And twilight’s balm won’t sooth your fears.

There’s much to do, so much untried  
Dreams unfulfilled, ambitions wide.  
Tasks undone and hopes unmet.  
An arduous quest incomplete yet.  
Goals unchecked on life’s scroll  
A journey still to make you whole.

A mile, a week, a medal more.  
A pending task, an undone chore.”  
“You can do it”, the voice will say.  
“Loans to lend, and debts to pay.  
When all is done, all intents complete,  
Then you will find peace and sleep sweet.

You’ve erred and must amend  
Do more towards a perfect end!  
Pursue a while, endure the night.  
Through toil and pain, seek the light.  
Lament not the moments lost,  
Nor farewells hurried, at untold cost.  
Water’s grace and gentle touch,  
Beautiful, tranquil, yet demand so much.

The neighbour’s garden, lovely, fair,  
But greater realms await, somewhere.  
One life you have, you must pursue,  
All that’s grand, and all that’s new.  
Without a struggle, without a strive  
How can you ever feel alive?

Though sorrow weighs upon your heart,  
And weariness afflicts your every part  
Don’t stop a moment to tell your pain  
To sense, to feel, to believe-are not to gain.

Succumb not to emotions’ weight,  
Make use of each hour only to create.  
Idle rest, aimless chatter, a drifting smile  
Mere weaknesses, excesses unworthwhile.

At journey’s end, you’ll find your grace,  
For enduring trials, and life’s embrace.  
To grasp the calm, the state of bliss,  
Is not today’s, but tomorrow’s kiss.  
For only when your quest is through,  
Can peace and rest belong to you.”

A poem I recently wrote, on an unquenched desire, yearning, longing, and questing to do more, have more, and be more. On the absurdity of living a lifetime without having lived in a single moment.
