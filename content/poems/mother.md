Her eyes shine bright  
With love and kindness  
When she appears,  
Gone is the weariness  
After a long, hard night.  
Her concern and patience are  
endless.

All belongs to her, whatever is mine  
Her giving heart draws no  
boundaries and no line.  
The lord is truly great for making  
a creature so fine.  

With her there is no hunger  
Neither of body, nor of soul.  
She is my pillar of strength as I  
was younger,  
and as I grow old.  

An endless sea of empathy flows  
through her heart  
She is God's greatest gift,  
A blessing and a work of art,  
Like her there is by far no other  
An embodiment of wisdom, love, and dedication,  
My pure and beautiful mother!

तुम्हारा चेहरा मेरा घर है,  
तुम्हारी बाहें मेरी पनाह,  
तुम्हारा होना मेरी ताक़त।  
तुम अपनों भी हो, अपनापन भी हो  
रहना हमेशा यूँ ही ऐसी हो तुम  
तुम माँ भी, और खुदा भी हो।
