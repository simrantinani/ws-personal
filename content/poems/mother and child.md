summary: "A reflection on the bond between a mother and her child, told through the lens of another species. An honest look at the hidden cost of daily rituals."

Her child is born, so tender, so sweet
A thousand words could never describe the love that flows
And never have heaven and earth been this close,
When mother’s and child’s gazes finally meet.

The proud, doting mother before her beholds
The most beautiful child she has ever seen
For them, in each other, a brand new world unfolds
A world in which, to each other, the whole world they mean.

So what if there is no green grass, no blue sky?
So what if there is no sun that shines?
So what if the only colours are the walls’ greys and the blood’s red?
They still have each other, and so they are fine.

Only her bosom can give his tiny body the nourishment it needs,
It is her whom he must follow whenever she leads.
She longs just as much as any other
To feed her own child with the milk that drips from every new mother.

But there is someone somewhere, not far
Who decided he would not let that innocent child mar
His God-gifted birthright, his want, his greed
To drink the sweet milk that is only that young baby’s need.

The man promptly went to the terrible hell
Where pain is what you breathe and blood is what you smell.
He went to where the mother and child lay,
Put a rope around that tender neck and started to lead the child away.

Each day as she cried and called for her child
The wretched milk was squeezed out with painful machines.
And each day more and more profits were filed.
And maybe you will find that young son’s tormented gaze
In the leather bag for which he was skinned alive.

Behind every glass of milk
There was a mother that was raped repeatedly and eventually killed.
And behind every ice-cream cone there are agonized screams.
And for every bit of butter on your bread
There was an innocent child that was born, but is now dead.
