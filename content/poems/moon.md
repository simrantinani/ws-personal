Mystery wanderer of the sky,  
Watchful guide of the voyager on land,  
Silent observer of the night going by,  
To forlorn and joyless, a wistful friend.

Muse to longing lovers, both canine and primate,  
Trusted confidant to the jilted and forlorn;  
Harbringer alike of auspice and damned fate,  
Compelling, commanding of admiration and scorn.

Lone warrior, graceful liege,  
Encircled amid an army of stars,  
Ever-transitional: accompanied or besieged?  
One can never know from so much afar.
