After months, I was hit by a bout of poetic inspiration by these beautiful scenes of November’s Beaver moon.

> Mystery wanderer of the sky,  
> Watchful guide of the voyager on land,  
> Silent observer of the night going by,  
> To forlorn and joyless, a wistful friend.
> 
> Muse to longing lovers, both canine and primate,  
> Trusted confidant to the jilted and forlorn;  
> Harbringer alike of auspice and damned fate,  
> Compelling, commanding of admiration and scorn.
> 
> Lone warrior, graceful liege,  
> Encircled amid an army of stars,  
> Ever-transitional: accompanied or besieged?  
> One can never know from so much afar.

Another set of important inspirations were some other poems on the moon that I read before composing my own. The ones I loved the most were

_Astrophil and Stella 31_ by Sir Philip Sidney;

_To the Moon_ by Percy Bysshe Shelley;

_Strange fits of passion I have known_ by William Wordsworth;

_I Watched The Moon Around The House_ by Emily Disckson;

_The Freedom Of The Moon_ by Robert Frost;

_Moon Compasses_ by Robert Frost;

_A Hymn to the Moon_ by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu;

_The Moon_ by Robert Louis Stevenson
