A personally curated directory of organizations and resources I've come across in the animal welfare space that seem to be doing interesting, high-impact work. Most organizations in this directory emphasize evidence-based approaches with rigorous research, data-driven decision-making, and measurable outcomes to maximize impact per dollar spent.  

**Important caveats:** This is just a subset of what I've encountered, and is not based on comprehensive research. I've likely missed many excellent organizations, don't know everything about the ones listed here, and am not affiliated with or personally vouching for any of them. This directory is based on publicly available information as of January 2026. Organizations evolve rapidly, so visit their websites for current information about programs, impact, and funding needs. Use this as a starting point for your own research, not as definitive recommendations.



## Research & Evaluation Organizations

### <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE)</a>

ACE conducts rigorous annual evaluations to identify the most effective animal charities worldwide. They recommend organizations based on cost-effectiveness, room for more funding, and leadership quality. ACE also runs a Movement Grants program supporting promising projects around the globe and provides the Recommended Charity Fund for donors seeking to maximize impact. Since founding in 2012, ACE estimates it has influenced over 81 million dollars in funding to recommended charities from 2014–2020, with an additional 59 million dollars influenced between January 2019 and March 2025.


### <a href="https://faunalytics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faunalytics</a>

A nonprofit research organization providing data-driven insights to animal advocates. Faunalytics conducts original studies, maintains a library of over 5,000 research summaries, and offers one-on-one research support to advocates and organizations. Their work covers topics from dietary interventions to political advocacy strategies, making academic research accessible and actionable. They help the movement make evidence-based decisions through rigorous methodology, transparent reporting, and practical recommendations.


### <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rethink Priorities</a>

A research organization conducting critical research to inform policymakers and major foundations about how to best help people and animals. Their animal welfare department produces influential work on moral weight estimates across species, cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions, and strategic prioritization research. Key contributions include the Moral Weight Project (comparing welfare capacities across species), invertebrate sentience research, and wild animal welfare landscape analyses. Their research helps funders and advocates allocate resources to the most impactful interventions.

### <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentience Institute</a>

An EA-aligned think tank researching how to most effectively expand humanity's moral circle to include all sentient beings. Founded in 2017 by Jacy Reese Anthis and Kelly Anthis as a spinoff from the Effective Altruism Foundation, SI takes a longtermist perspective focused on improving the long-term future for all sentient entities. Key outputs include the *Summary of Evidence for Foundational Questions in Effective Animal Advocacy* (aggregating research on confrontational vs. moderate tactics, individual vs. institutional change, and other strategic debates), social movement case studies (British antislavery, nuclear power adoption), and the *Animals, Food, and Technology* survey tracking US attitudes. They also host the Sentience Institute Podcast featuring deep-dive interviews on advocacy strategy. While initially focused on farmed animals, SI now allocates substantial resources to artificial sentience research—exploring the moral consideration of digital minds before they potentially become widespread. Co-founder Jacy Anthis's book *The End of Animal Farming* synthesizes much of their research for general audiences.

## Direct Impact Organizations

### <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Humane League (THL)</a>

A global nonprofit ending the abuse of animals raised for food through corporate campaigns and policy change. THL has contributed to securing over 3,000 commitments from companies worldwide to improve chicken welfare, including cage-free pledges from McDonald's, Starbucks, and Walmart. In the US, cage-free hen production rose from approximately 3% to 45.7% over the past 15 years, largely due to work by THL and allied organizations.

They've secured numerous cage-free commitments and work to shift markets away from factory farming.

### <a href="https://www.sinergiaanimalinternational.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sinergia Animal</a>

In 2024, LIC won a landmark ruling in LIC v. Alexandre establishing that animal protection organizations can sue agricultural companies for cruelty violations. ACE-evaluated charity recognized for innovative legal approach with potential to help the 9+ billion chickens killed annually in the US.

### <a href="https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shrimp Welfare Project</a>

They've secured stunning commitments covering over 3 billion shrimp annually and published the first Shrimp Welfare Index.

WAI funds research grants, conducts original research, and supports scientists studying how to understand and eventually improve wild animal welfare. They've received over $9 million from Open Philanthropy and published influential research on topics from wildlife contraception to welfare indicators. ACE Recommended Charity since 2020—the only non-farmed-animal-focused organization to receive their top recommendation.


### <a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Good Food Institute</a>

GFI publishes the authoritative annual State of Alternative Proteins reports, funds academic research grants, supports the Alt Protein Project student network (with chapters in 11+ countries), and engages policymakers on cultivated meat regulation. While private investment in alt proteins declined to $1.1 billion in 2024, GFI continues building the scientific and policy infrastructure for long-term sector growth.
