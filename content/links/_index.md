A personally curated directory of organizations and resources I've come across in the animal welfare space that seem to be doing interesting, high-impact work. Most organizations in this directory emphasize evidence-based approaches with rigorous research, data-driven decision-making, and measurable outcomes to maximize impact per dollar spent.  

**Important caveats:** This is just a subset of what I've encountered, and is not based on comprehensive research. I've likely missed many excellent organizations, don't know everything about the ones listed here, and am not affiliated with or personally vouching for any of them. This directory is based on publicly available information as of January 2026. Organizations evolve rapidly, so visit their websites for current information about programs, impact, and funding needs. Use this as a starting point for your own research, not as definitive recommendations.
