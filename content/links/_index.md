A personally curated directory of organizations and resources I've come across in the animal welfare space that seem to be doing important, high-impact work. Most organizations in this directory emphasize evidence-based approaches with rigorous research, data-driven decision-making, and measurable outcomes to maximize impact per dollar spent.  

**Important caveats:** This is just a subset of what I've encountered, and is not based on comprehensive research. I've likely missed many excellent organizations, don't know everything about the ones listed here, and am not affiliated with or personally vouching for any of them.  This directory is based on publicly available information as of January 2026. Organizations evolve rapidly, so visit their websites for current information about programs, impact, and funding needs. Use this as a starting point for your own research, not as definitive recommendations. Further, this directory does not have much material on individual change.....

##  Why this Matters and Individual Action

### Understand the Problem

Every year, humans kill more animals for food, clothing, and entertainment than the total number of humans who have _ever existed_, most in conditions of extreme confinement and suffering.

 An <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> estimated</u></a> 99% of US farmed animals live on factory farms.
In <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>food production</u></a>, approximately 9 billion chickens, 128 million pigs, and 36 million cattle are killed yearly in the US alone, with an estimated <a href="https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1–2 trillion wild fish</u></a> caught from oceans and <a href="https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2/numbers-of-farmed-fish-slaughtered-each-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>over 100 billion farmed</u></a> in aquaculture annually. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow-calf_separation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dairy industry</u></a> involves repeated artificial insemination and distressful separation of calves from their mothers. Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>7 billion male chicks</u></a> are killed annually worldwide in egg production. Beyond food, animals suffer in <a href="https://aldf.org/issue/animals-in-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>entertainment</u></a> (zoos, marine parks, circuses, racing, rodeos), <a href="https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clothing production</u></a> (fur, leather, wool, down), and <a href="https://www.humaneworld.org/italy/en/issue/about-animal-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>animal testing</u></a>. For comprehensive overviews, see <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>80,000 Hours' factory farming problem profile</u></a>, <a href="https://faunalytics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Faunalytics</u></a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-are-factory-farmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Our World in Data</u></a>.

 A substantial scientific literature supports that these animals are _sentient_, that is, capable of subjective experience, including physical pain and affective emotional states such as fear and distress. The evidence is extensive; some representative reviews are: <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9100576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fish sentience</u></a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1064-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>chickens’ cognition and emotion</u></a>, <a href="https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=acwp_asie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pigs’ cognitive and emotional complexity </u></a>, and distress associated with common dairy practices such as <a href="https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302%2819%2930436-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cow–calf separation</u></a>. 
 
Many philosophers, ethicists, and researchers have argued that the scale of suffering caused to nonhuman animals represents one of the most severe and neglected _moral crises in history_.

### Paths to Impact

Individuals can help animals in many ways, including changing their diets and lifestyles to eliminate or reduce animal products, donating to impactful animal welfare organizations, choosing advocacy-focused careers, and volunteering their free time and skills. 

Being vegan is one of the most direct ways to withdraw personal support from systems that cause animal suffering. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</u></a> (2016) stated that well-planned vegan diets are nutritionally adequate for all life stages; a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39923894/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2025 update</u></a> reaffirmed adequacy for adults specifically. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8623061/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Clinical guidelines</u></a> note that attention to certain nutrients (like B12, vitamin D) is important for long-term health; practical guidance on meeting these needs is available from the <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrition-overview-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Society</u></a>, <a href="https://veganhealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Health</u></a>, and <a href="https://veganoutreach.org/plant-based-nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Outreach</u></a>. <a href="https://www.happycow.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HappyCow</u></a> helps locate plant-based restaurants when eating out. Structured programs can help with the transition: <a href="https://veganuary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Veganuary</u></a> and <a href="https://challenge22.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Challenge 22</u></a> offer daily guidance, recipes, and mentorship from registered dietitians, and attract participation in the millions.

Communication skills can extend the impact of individual change by shaping everyday conversations and social norms. The <a href="https://veganadvocacy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Advocacy Initiative</u></a> provides training grounded in social psychology; and <a href="https://faunalytics.org/category/effective-advocacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Faunalytics’ Effective Advocacy resources</u></a> synthesize evidence on framing and messaging. Sustaining individual action is also easier with targeted support: <a href="https://veganpsychologist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Psychologist</u></a>  and <a href="https://carnism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Beyond Carnism</u></a> addresses distress, burnout, and interpersonal friction; while <a href="https://www.theveganrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Vegan RD</u></a> provides nutrition guidance.

While individual veganism is a great way to express moral consistency and influence social norms, institutional strategies such as <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/better-for-animals-the-evidence-behind-corporate-outreach-for-welfare-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> corporate campaigns</u></a> can produce large, measurable, and cost-effective improvements for animals in the near term. 
Thus, beyond personal choices, an individual can amplify their impact by supporting organizations with the capacity to deliver change at scale. This can be done through donating, volunteering, or building a career in the animal advocacy space. For time-constrained volunteering, <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/fast-action-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Humane League’s Fast Action Network</u></a> and <a href="https://mercyforanimals.org/take-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mercy For Animals’ Take Action hub</u></a> offer quick actions; for higher-leverage roles, <a href="https://medium.com/@animalcharityev/8-ways-to-volunteer-for-animals-effectively-7b850978fd27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ACE’s volunteering guidance </u></a> helps align effort with impact. 

The rest of this document lists some reputed organizations with documented evidence of impact that are known to me. These are potential avenues for giving, volunteering, or even career opportunities.

## Books & Podcasts

### Books


- **Animal Liberation Now** by Peter Singer (2023)
The updated and expanded edition of the 1975 classic that launched the modern animal rights movement. Singer revisits his groundbreaking arguments with new material on factory farming's role in climate change and pandemic risk, reforms in the EU and US states, and the explosion of factory farming in China. Named one of TIME's "All-TIME 100 Best Non-Fiction Books." Essential reading for understanding the philosophical foundations of animal advocacy. Features an introduction by Yuval Noah Harari.

- **The End of Animal Farming** by Jacy Reese Anthis (2018)
A strategic roadmap for transitioning to an animal-free food system, written from an effective altruism perspective. Anthis is co-founder of Sentience Institute, an EA-aligned think tank researching how to most effectively expand humanity's moral circle. The book analyzes the social forces, technology, and activism driving change—from plant-based meat to cultivated protein. Unlike books focused on individual diet change, this emphasizes institutional transformation. Praised by Steven Pinker as placing "the issue of factory farming in the context of human progress."

- **Eating Animals** by Jonathan Safran Foer (2009)
