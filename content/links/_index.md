A personally curated directory of organizations and resources in the animal welfare space. Coverage spans the scale and severity of the problem, paths to individual and institutional impact, direct-action and research organizations, giving platforms, career development, and learning resources including newsletters, books, podcasts, and academic journals. Most organizations listed emphasize evidence-based approaches and measurable outcomes.

**Caveats:** This is a subset of what I've encountered, not comprehensive research. I've likely missed excellent organizations, don't know everything about those listed, and am not affiliated with or vouching for any. Information is current as of January 2026; organizations evolve, so visit their websites directly. Use this as a starting point, not as definitive recommendations.

##  Why this Matters

### Understand the Problem

Every year, humans kill more animals for food, clothing, and entertainment than the total number of humans who have _ever existed_, most in conditions of extreme confinement and suffering.

 An <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> estimated</u></a> 99% of US farmed animals live on factory farms.
In <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>food production</u></a>, approximately 9 billion chickens, 128 million pigs, and 36 million cattle are killed yearly in the US alone, with an estimated <a href="https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1–2 trillion wild fish</u></a> caught from oceans and <a href="https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2/numbers-of-farmed-fish-slaughtered-each-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>over 100 billion farmed</u></a> in aquaculture annually. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow-calf_separation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dairy industry</u></a> involves repeated artificial insemination and distressful separation of calves from their mothers. Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>7 billion male chicks</u></a> are killed annually worldwide in egg production. Beyond food, animals suffer in <a href="https://aldf.org/issue/animals-in-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>entertainment</u></a> (zoos, marine parks, circuses, racing, rodeos), <a href="https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clothing production</u></a> (fur, leather, wool, down), and <a href="https://www.humaneworld.org/italy/en/issue/about-animal-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>animal testing</u></a>. For comprehensive overviews, see <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>80,000 Hours' factory farming problem profile</u></a>, <a href="https://faunalytics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Faunalytics</u></a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-are-factory-farmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Our World in Data</u></a>.

 A substantial scientific literature supports that these animals are _sentient_, that is, capable of subjective experience, including physical pain and affective emotional states such as fear and distress. The evidence is extensive; some representative reviews are: <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9100576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fish sentience</u></a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1064-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>chickens’ cognition and emotion</u></a>, <a href="https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=acwp_asie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pigs’ cognitive and emotional complexity </u></a>, and distress associated with common dairy practices such as <a href="https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302%2819%2930436-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cow–calf separation</u></a>. 
 
Many philosophers, ethicists, and researchers have argued that the degree and scale of suffering caused to nonhuman animals represent the most severe and neglected _moral crisis in history_.

### Paths to Impact

Individuals can help animals in many ways, including changing their diets and lifestyles to eliminate or reduce animal products, donating to impactful animal welfare organizations, choosing advocacy-focused careers, and volunteering their free time and skills. 

Being vegan is the most direct ways to withdraw personal support from systems that cause animal suffering. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</u></a> (2016) stated that well-planned vegan diets are nutritionally adequate for all life stages; a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39923894/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2025 update</u></a> reaffirmed this for adults. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8623061/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Clinical guidelines</u></a> emphasize attention to certain nutrients (like B12, vitamin D) for long-term health; practical guidance on meeting these needs is available from the <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrition-overview-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Society</u></a>, <a href="https://veganhealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Health</u></a>, <a href="https://veganoutreach.org/plant-based-nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Outreach</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.theveganrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Vegan RD</u></a>. <a href="https://www.happycow.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HappyCow</u></a> helps locate plant-based restaurants when eating out. Structured programs can help with the transition: <a href="https://veganuary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Veganuary</u></a> and <a href="https://challenge22.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Challenge 22</u></a> offer daily guidance, recipes, and support from registered dietitians, and attract participation in the millions.

Communication skills can extend the impact of individual change by shaping everyday conversations and social norms. The <a href="https://veganadvocacy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Advocacy Initiative</u></a> provides training grounded in social psychology; and <a href="https://faunalytics.org/category/effective-advocacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Faunalytics’ Effective Advocacy resources</u></a> synthesize evidence on framing and messaging. Sustaining individual action is easier with targeted support: <a href="https://veganpsychologist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vegan Psychologist</u></a> and <a href="https://carnism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Beyond Carnism</u></a> addresses distress, burnout, and interpersonal friction.

#### Beyond Individual Action

Individual actions matter. Choosing plant-based foods, caring for rescued animals, and making compassionate daily choices reflect personal integrity and reduce direct participation in harmful systems. However, the unimaginable scale of animal use means that individual consumption changes alone cannot address the problem within any reasonable timeframe. Many advocates stop at personal lifestyle changes without realizing that some of the highest-impact opportunities lie in shifting institutions, policies, and social norms.

 <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/better-for-animals-the-evidence-behind-corporate-outreach-for-welfare-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Corporate campaigns</u></a>, for example, have secured welfare commitments affecting hundreds of millions of animals through the work of relatively small teams. Thus, beyond personal choices, an individual can amplify their impact by supporting organizations with the capacity to deliver change at scale. This can be done through donating, volunteering, or building a career in the animal advocacy space. For time-constrained volunteering, <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/fast-action-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Humane League’s Fast Action Network</u></a> and <a href="https://mercyforanimals.org/take-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mercy For Animals’ Take Action hub</u></a> offer quick actions; for higher-leverage roles, <a href="https://medium.com/@animalcharityev/8-ways-to-volunteer-for-animals-effectively-7b850978fd27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ACE’s volunteering guidance </u></a> helps align effort with impact.  
 
 Strategic donations to effective organizations can spare orders of magnitude more animals than a single person's dietary choices over a lifetime. The following resources can help translate that concern into broader impact.
