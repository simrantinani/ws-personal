Hello! My name is Simran. I work in computer security and have a background in mathematics and cryptography. I maintain a <a href="https://simrantinani.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate website</a> where I write about those professional interests.

This present website is a canvas for the ideas and experiences that matter to me outside of work. My writing here touches on questions of mind and feeling, personal well-being, the social patterns we live within, and the ethics of how we treat other beings. Most of my writing takes the form of essays and notes drawn from reflection, reading, conversation, and lived experience. Some essays revisit the books I love, particularly classics, highlighting my favourite passages and the thoughts they left me with. I also occasionally write poems on the same themes that preoccupy my prose. 


This website brings together a few main threads:

### [Poems](/poems/)
A collection of notes structured notes, technical explanations of concepts, and code walkthroughs. A few may be links to external websites, when the work was done in professional capacity. 
- [Home of Being](/poems/)
- [Pursuit](/poems/)


Topics vary, but so far include (formatting of the posts is still immature and work in progress): 

- [Poems](/poems/)
- [Essays](/among-animals/)  
- [Book Revisits](/book-revisits)  
- [Links](/links/)  

### Distant Kindred
Two animals at nearby sanctuaries whose care I support. Being able to support their care and follow their lives adds a great deal of meaning to mine.
