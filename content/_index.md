Hello! My name is Simran, and I'm an IT Security Analyst with a background in applied mathematics and cryptography. I spend some of my free time learning core security concepts and trying to better understand the workings of systems, software, and the web. This website is a small space to gather notes and articles from my personal projects and study, and to document my existing research work. All opinions expressed on this site are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer or any affiliated organization.

One recent project is ***[Nutshell Cryptography](https://nutshellcryptography.pages.dev/)***  – an interactive tool that simplifies cryptographic concepts through structured categorization and visualization. It is a first exercise in JavaScript, built with React and Vite, and reflects a personal goal to make complex ideas more accessible. The project is still a work in progress, and parts of it remain incomplete or experimental.


This website brings together a few main threads:

### [Writeups](/writeups/)
A collection of notes structured notes, technical explanations of concepts, and code walkthroughs. A few may be links to external websites, when the work was done in professional capacity. 

**Latest post:** [Compilation, Interpretation, and Typing](/writeups/plbasics/)

Topics vary, but so far include (formatting of the posts is still immature and work in progress): 

- [Posts on cryptography](/writeups/#cryptography)
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also see ***[Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.cnlab.ch/fileadmin/documents/Publikationen/2025/Post-Quantum_Cryptography_-__A_Comprehensive_Guide.pdf)***, which I co-authored at cnlab.
- [Some notes from my studies on systems and security](/writeups/#systems-applications-security)  
- [Occasional notes on AI and machine learning](/writeups/#ai-and-machine-learning)  
- [Fragments of theoretical computer science](/writeups/#theoretical-computer-science)  
- [Two oldish pure mathematics posts](/writeups/#mathematics)  

### [Research](/research/)

A record of my academic work, including research in mathematical cryptography during my doctoral studies.


### [About](/about/)

A bit more about me and this website.
