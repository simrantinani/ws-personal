Nature at its best, humans at their worst: The Indian Garbage Problem

So much beauty and so much ugliness together in one picture. It could break the toughest of hearts to see a sight so picturesque being ruined by a ton of unmanaged garbage. This is a sight I cross daily, living in a place close to what may easily be considered one of India's cleanest cities. Waste management is currently a dire issue faced by the country, which currently generates far more solid waste than it can handle. This, combined with the selfishness and corruption of leaders and common citizens, who refuse to see beyond their own conveniences and gains, has led to landfills overflowing, garbage being dumped illegally in open spaces, as the photo depicts, and massive air pollution due to the illegal burning of trash. The dumping of plastic waste additionally harms animals like cows, who end up consuming it, along with other hazardous waste material. 

As responsible and privileged citizens, it is our responsibility to understand the causes and effects of the garbage situation, and learn our part in curbing it. A few great articles that provide an overall and sufficiently detailed picture of the problem and its depth are linked to below.
