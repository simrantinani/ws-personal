-instance of a broader phenomenon observed in almost every person and culture

-most people want to have an impact on the world in some way or the other. Simply existing, surviving, even living merely for oneself and by oneself is unsatisfactory 

-ex: people starting a new business, technology, scientists - new discoveries, teachers -heloing students, doctors and psychologists - helping save and better lives, historians preserving history, writers bringing new ideas to the public, sharing stories, social workers.

-for people privileged enough to not have to worry about survival, careers are more and more about making a difference in the world

-helping people is a term that resonates over a broad range of career paths and choices. Everyone likes to believe they are important and of some worth to other people around and society in general

- need not be altruistic difference : business gives a feel of influence but may be done for mutual benefit

-altruism : something done without the expectation of a material benefjt. (Monetary, societal). Societal debatable - a person telling others may believe tbey do it for more good but subconsciously do it psrtly also for social approval. That's ok  humans exist in society not vacuum. Grey area - is a doctor altruistic? You can help people without it being an altruistic action. Similarly an action may be altruisric in intention but end up not doing much good

-ways that actually matter 

-ways that create the most difference for the cost involved 

-ways that optimize benefits per unit of cost

-cost: money, time, effort, expertise

-benefit: lives saved, suffering reduced

- me: always wanted to create impact for animals

- contemplated sociology but decide to pursue mathematics, then cryptography, then Cybersecurity. 

-for 4 years of PhD, lost touch with altruisric intentions meaning creating intentions and udeas. Hyperfocussed on finishing PhD and creating a career

- till last year, only concerned with own survival and career.

-now happy with job , career choice, also find meaning in it - not altruistic though

- wanting to come back to cause dearest to me : animals. Want to donate resources.How can i best donate my money and free time to make the most difference? My intention to come to the conference 

-understood earning to give but wantsd to get a feel for it and talk to real people who do it

-pledge

-why animals? -scale, nature, degree, repulsive, voiceless, innocent, no other advocate, no vote, money - no self representatives and no material incentive to help them
