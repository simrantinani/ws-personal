It feels uplifting to write about what feels like the beginning of a new chapter in my life—one that involves a bit of feathers and a lot of heart. I’ve adopted a chicken! While it’s a remote adoption, Marita, my newly adopted feathered friend, already feels like part of my family.

## Meet Marita: A Journey of Recovery

Marita is a so-called a hybrid egg chicken, bred to lay an egg almost every day. She spent the first 18 months of her life in challenging conditions, confined to a cramped barn with nearly 2,000 other chickens. Life in the egg industry is tough for these feeling creatures, and many chickens don’t make it through. Those who do often face a grim fate once they’re no longer as productive. Marita was one of the lucky ones who found a second chance at life.

In a transformational moment, the farmers at Marita’s Hof one day recognized the individual in their chickens and saw how truly painful this life is for the chickens. They made the compassionate decision to stop livestock farming and transform their farm into a sanctuary. Thanks to a strong campaign, Marita, along with her companions, was rehomed to places where they could live out their lives in peace. Marita now calls Hof Narr Zurich her home, a sanctuary dedicated to giving animals like her the care and respect they deserve.

## The Adoption

While Marita doesn’t live with me, I’m supporting her upbringing at Hof Narr Zurich. This means that my contributions help cover the costs of her care—ensuring she has a safe, comfortable, and happy life. Even though she’s miles away, knowing that I’m part of her journey brings a quiet sense of fulfillment.

I’m looking forward to visiting her at Hof Narr soon (update: I did! The picture above is from my visit). I imagine it will be a special moment to see her in person, to watch her enjoying her new life, and perhaps even to have her come up and say hello. It feels like a small step, but it’s a meaningful one for me, marking a new chapter in my life.

## Hof Narr Zurich

Hof Narr Zurich is where Marita now lives, and I’d like to take a moment to share the wonderful work they do. Hof Narr is not just a sanctuary; it’s a place where animals like Marita are given the opportunity to live freely and peacefully. The sanctuary is home to nearly 130 rescued animals, each with their own story of survival and recovery.

What makes Hof Narr special is their commitment to showing a different way of living alongside animals. They practice organic vegan farming and help other farmers transition away from traditional livestock farming. Through their educational efforts, they inspire visitors to consider more compassionate ways of living and farming.

Supporting Hof Narr feels like being part of something bigger—a quiet but powerful movement towards a world where all lives are valued.

## My Journey: From Uncertainty to Giving Back

Reflecting on my own journey, this adoption holds personal significance. Not long ago, I was a PhD student, navigating the uncertainties of finding a job and securing my place in the country where I was studying. I had no idea how much time or effort it would take before I secured a sense of my own stability. Therefore, even though I longed to give back and help out where I could, this was not always possible.

Now, with a bit more steadiness in my life, I’m in a position to support causes that resonate with me. Supporting Marita and the work at Hof Narr is one of those ways, and it feels good to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. It’s a reminder of how much has changed over the past year, and how grateful I am to be where I am now.
