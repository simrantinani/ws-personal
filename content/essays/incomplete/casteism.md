Hopefully, a good percentage of the educated youth of India has by now grown to learn that casteism of every variety and level is still prevalent in the country, and is responsible for the suffering and deaths of numerous people from the "lower" castes each year. 

Growing up, I have been privileged enough to never have to give a thought to my caste or anything related to it. I also never personally encountered any real-life incidents of caste-based discrimination around me, at least none that I could take note of. My knowledge and experience with this subject were limited to reading the news, scholarly literature, stories, and conversations with people. This changed a few years ago. This Ambedkar Jayanti, I write about my encounter with this malignant social evil.

I live in an area surrounded by well-educated, well-to-do people, who hold a good amount of respect in society. A few years back, we had a housemaid working for us, let's call her Taj. Taj also worked in a lot of houses nearby, and was mostly engaged all day with work. She would come to the neighbourhood early in the morning, work till afternoon, go back home in-between for an hour or two (that too, not to rest, but to cook for her family), then come back and work again till evening. She never complained or tried to avoid work, and was always jovial and talkative. She was doing quite well for herself, and was happy with her earnings, as well as her husband's. Her children did well at school and had earned scholarships for their studies.

Most people in the neighbourhood had seen Taj around at some point or the other, and everyone whose houses she worked at liked her very much. However, one day's incident would change her happy status forever. On one day, when Taj did not arrive for work as usual, she called us and told us that she was not being allowed into our gated housing society by the watchmen, as the secretary of this society had prohibited her entry.
