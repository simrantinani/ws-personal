Sometimes, life happens and we lose our loved established routines and our momentum for our most enjoyed good habits. Of late, I haven’t been able to be very consistent with my workouts, especially with my strength-based workouts. In general, the last several months have not been great for my gym-going routine.

Starting this year, I spent a lot more of my exercise time playing badminton, and this naturally took time and energy away from my strength workouts. Also, since March, a lot of time went into studying and working on a project for a course I am studying as part of my continuing education program. However, the biggest setback started last month, when I went on a week of vacation in Portugal, and returned with a nasty virus that made me sicker than I’ve ever been, and kept me in bed for a week, and at home for another week. So, it had been a month since I did any strength-based exercise (actually, almost any exercise), and I had to take things slow when I first stepped back into the gym.

I kept my workouts simple, and started very lightly, and slowly built up strength. Here are some general guiding principles I used to gradually increase difficulty.

1.  I started off on a day when I could still feel a remnant portion of the fatigue from the sickness. However, on this day, my body finally told me it was ready for some movement. I took it really very easy on this day, and counted the walk to the gym as part of the workout. I did just as much as felt comfortable, and took as long breaks as I needed. I used either no or very light weights and used simpler variations of the exercises when needed. I made sure that the exercises (listed below) were not too intense or stressful, so I did nothing with barbells, and no compound moves.
2.  I did not work out on the day after the first, and took a day in-between to rest. I kept the second workout also very easy, adding a little bit of weight only where things felt too easy. Until now, I did no cardiovascular exercises, which felt like too much with the remnant fatigue.
3.  On the third day, I was able to start challenging myself a bit in terms of the weights and number of repetitions. I kept the exercises the same as on the first day. I felt a clear difference in my abilities, energy, and the ease of the workout. I started to feel motivated to push a bit harder. This is when the workout stopped to feel mechanical and completely basic.
4.  Compounds: After 4-5 consistent workouts with increasing weights and intensity, I started barbell-based compound lifts: squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.
5.  Warming up: As always, but especially when returning after a break, warming up is important. This means starting off with very light or no weights and fewer repetitions in the first sets, and slowly building up the load based on the ease and one’s feeling.
6.  The biggest achievement (and the most important principle), however, was not the workouts, but the fact that I consistently listened to my body and stayed patient, only doing the amount that I was able to, and refraining from taking on too much.
7.  Exercises: the workout was very simple, and I deliberately did not include too many different exercises. Yet, it covers the whole body and is very effective. Below are the exercises.

## 1\. Core and arms: (Weighted) Planks

Planks are a core-strengthening exercise that involves holding a position with the body in a straight line from head to heels, supported by the forearms and toes. This exercise targets the abdominals, back, arms, and in part, also the legs, and is highly effective for overall body conditioning and balance. Since planks are a full-body exercise, are relatively easy on the body, and can easily be customized in terms of difficulty by changing the amount of time and adding weights, they are very suitable and effective for a beginner or for someone returning after a break.


## 2\. Upper body: (Weighted) Push-ups

Push-ups are an underrated exercise that can be a game-changer for overall upper body strength and balance. They target the chest, back, core, and arms, and also partly, the lower body. They can be customized in several ways, by going on one’s knees to make them easier, and by adding weight to make them more challenging. They can be hard for a beginner, but strength builds up rather fast if one is consistent.


## 3\. Lower body (Hamstrings): Dumbbell deadlifts

For simplicity and ease, the lower body exercises can be divided into two parts: one for the hamstrings and the other for the quadriceps and glutes. Instead of barbell deadlifts, which are less customizable (the barbell itself is 20 kg) and more stressful, and therefore, less suitable for a return from a break (especially after sickness). The dumbbell version, on the other hand, is less stressful and easier to customize, as any weight can be used. Nevertheless, this exercise is very effective in building or re-building hamstring strength, and also engages the core.

## 4\. Lower body (quads & glutes): Kettlebell squats and swings

Barbell squats can be intense, both on the legs and upper body, and also cardiovascularly. They are also not customizable because of the weight of the barbell. They are thus not suitable for returning from a break or beginning. Dumbbell squats are easier, but can still be stressful on the upper body. On the other hand, kettlebells are easier to grasp and naturally distribute their weight across the legs. Kettlebell squats and swings are therefore the winner exercises for the quadriceps and glutes in this workout.

## 5\. Upper body (shoulders, arms) Dumbbell shoulder raises/curls/tricep pushdowns

While the pushups worked the whole upper body, it makes sense to add one more isolating exercise to complete the routine. For this, one may alternate between dumbbell shoulder raises, bicep curls, or tricep pushdowns, targeting shoulders one day, biceps the next, and triceps the next.

## 6\. Stretching!

Stretching is essential at the end of every workout. But when one has been on a break for a long time, especially due to sickness, when one lies down or sits for prolonged periods, stretching becomes all the more important. It also feels great and relaxing. The workout targeted the whole body, so it is important to incorporate stretches also for every part of the body.
