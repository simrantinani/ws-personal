I only began cooking this month, having moved to a new place, and am still surprised over how enjoyable and soothing this activity is. This weekend I cooked two rather contrasting breakfast dishes. The first was lemon-flavoured quinoa upma, which seems like a western modification (i.e. the quinoa part) of the popular Indian breakfast of upma. The second was a veganized typical Punjabi breakfast: potato paratha (a sort of salty pancake?) with cooked vegetable-dal curry, non-dairy butter, and strawberry-flavoured soya yogurt. It was actually pleasantly surprising how identical the taste of the non-dairy butter was to dairy butter: one couldn't tell the difference at all. The soya yogurt was absolutely delicious, as well. There are such varied, easily available and affordable alternatives to every single non-vegan food that I cannot fathom why most people are still eating dead animals and their secretions.
